# CodeFights

### Solutions to various CodeFights problems, mostly in JavaScript or Python.

And just be be clear, many of the solutions are an attempt to to solve problems with as little code as
possible, that includes not using semicolon for the sake of reducing the code by as little as one char,
creating variable without declaring, etc.

Much of it isn't pretty, often time complexitiy is not the main concern (exluding Job Interview / Challenges)
problems sets. I'm just having fun learning to use various ES6 functions.
